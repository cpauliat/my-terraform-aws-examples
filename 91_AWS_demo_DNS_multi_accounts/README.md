## Demo91: Simplify DNS management in a multi-account environment with Route 53 Resolver

See https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-dns-management-in-a-multiaccount-environment-with-route-53-resolver/

This is the third use case in this blog (no on-premises):

- acct0 is the central DNS AWS account (on the botton in the diagram)
- acct1 is the AWS account #1 (containing host host1.acct1.Awscloud.private, on the top left in the diagram)
- acct2 is the AWS account #2 (containing host host2.acct2.Awscloud.private, on the top middle in the diagram)
